Hi there! I'm a Graphics Programmer at [Marmoset](http://marmoset.co/), where I work on Toolbag - a software for 3D artists with rendering, texturing & baking features. I graduated from University of Utah in 2024 with a Masters in Computing and a specilization in Graphics & Visualization. My research at the U revolved around a novel appraoch to 3d modelling with [Prof Cem Yuksel](http://www.cemyuksel.com/) as my advisor.

Previously, I conducted research on storytelling, education, and novel interaction techniques for AR/VR at the [IMXD Lab](https://imxd.in), IIT Bombay, under [Prof Jayesh Pillai](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/pillai-jayesh). I also worked as the Technical Director of [Manhole Collective](https://manholecollective.com/), the creators of the real-time animated short film [Manhole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYyHxQjr3Z8), which won third place in [Unreal's Short film challenge](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/watch-the-top-projects-from-the-shorts-india-program) in India and was screened at the prestigious Annecy film festival.
